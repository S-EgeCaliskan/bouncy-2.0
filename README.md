## Bouncy 2.0

### Made using Unity and C#

This is the second flappy bird clone I made with Unity, the source code of the first one I made was lost. So I gave it a go to polish my Unity Engine and C# knowledge to remake it.

Unity is a popular engine, and that makes it a good opportunity to find solutions by navigating the web whenever I got stuck on a problem. People had similar problems to what I had, and by adapting the solutions to my current project, I was able to speed up the process.
